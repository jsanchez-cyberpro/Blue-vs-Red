## Blue Team vs Read Team

In this Repository we will mimic the work The Red and Blue Team play in Cybersecurity. We will go over both roles Pentester and SOC Analyst.  


### Red Team
As Red Team, we will attack a vulnerable VM within our enviroment that acts as a webserver. The ultimate goal is to gain root access to the machine and capture the flag.  



### Blue Team 

As Blue Team, we will use kibana to review logs taken during the attack engagement. We will use the logs to extract hard data and vizualizations for reports. 
Then, we will interpret the log data collected to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that we have successfully performed.
