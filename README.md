The files in this repository were used to configure Cloud Network and ELK deployment. Furthermore it includes different Scripts done during Linux and Bash Scripting week to automate system administration tasks using loops. 


### Ansible
The files have been tested and used to generate a live Cloud & ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured in the diagram section. Alternatively, select portions of the filebeat-playbook.yml file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat, Metricbeats and Ansible. They also offer an insight into bash scripting used during the Bash Scripting and Programming. 



### Diagram
The diagram section of the repository  is a graphical representation of the project and is composed of a series of connected arrows and boxes to describe the interrelationship between the activities involved in the project. Boxes or nodes represent the description of activities and arrows show the relationship among the activities.


### Linux 

The linux portion of the project is composed of scripts that completes several system audit steps automatically. 
The used of if statements are utilized to improve scripting skills by allowing you to:
Check if a file or directory exists before it's created it.
Check what user has run the script.
And more...
The use of loops facilitates code reuse, by allowing commands to be run many times without actually typing them repeatedly. 
It will help you add another layer of sophistication and efficiency to your scripts. 
The Linux section will also allow you to take for loops a bit further. You will be able to do things such as:
Loop through all the users in the system and take an action for each one.
Loop through the results of a find command and take action on each item found.
Loop through a list of files, check their permissions and change them if needed.
Loop through a list of files and create cryptographics hash of each file.
